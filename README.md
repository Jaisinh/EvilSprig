# EvilSprig

**EvilSprig** is a mischievous project that transforms a normal Sprig into an *evil* device by leveraging the power of CircuitPython and the HID library. With this, you can automate keystrokes to execute pranks, like directing unsuspecting users to the infamous Rick Roll!

## Features

- **Turns your Sprig evil**: Automatically types and executes commands or URLs.
- **Built using CircuitPython**: Utilizes the HID library to simulate a keyboard.
- **Compact and efficient**: Minimal code to achieve maximum impact.
- **Rick Roll prank included**: Redirects to everyone's favorite URL.

## How It Works

EvilSprig acts as a USB HID device that mimics a keyboard. Upon connection, it performs the following steps:
1. Waits for a few seconds to ensure the system is ready.
2. Simulates opening the browser (via `COMMAND + SPACE`, then typing "Safari").
3. Automatically types a Rick Roll URL (`bit.ly/3P4lQBj`) and presses Enter.
4. Enjoy the chaos!

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements
- A **Sprig** console with CircuitPython support.
- CircuitPython libraries:
  - `adafruit_hid`
  
### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Copy the `code.py` file to your Sprig's filesystem.
3. Ensure the required libraries are in the `lib/` folder of your device.
   - Specifically, include the `adafruit_hid` library.
4. Connect your Sprig to a computer via USB.

### Usage
1. Plug in the EvilSprig to a computer.
2. The device waits for 5 seconds to allow the system to stabilize.
3. It opens the browser and types the Rick Roll URL.
4. Watch your unsuspecting target enjoy the fun! ðŸŽµ

## Code Overview

The core functionality is implemented using the following:
- **CircuitPython HID Library**: Simulates keyboard keypresses.
- **Predefined Commands**: Sends specific keystrokes to open a browser and navigate to a URL.

### Key Functions
- `type_text(text)`: Types a given string character by character, handling special keys (e.g., numbers, periods, etc.).
- `keyboard.press()`: Simulates a keypress.
- `keyboard.release_all()`: Releases all pressed keys.
